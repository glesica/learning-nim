# Learning Nim

A bunch of little Nim programs that I've written while working through the Nim
documentation [1]. There is a Makefile, just run `make` to build everything.
Binaries will be placed in the `bin/` directory.

Not all of the programs follow the examples exactly, in some cases I explored
a bit because I was curious. In other cases I found the example program obvious
or boring and skipped it altogether.
